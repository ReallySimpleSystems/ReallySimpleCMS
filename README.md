## About the project
**ReallySimpleCMS** is a website content management system designed to be a lightweight but powerful alternative to older CMS software such as WordPress. It is built on a modern codebase that is free of backwards compatible clutter that plagues older systems. The best part is that ReallySimpleCMS is completely free! Future functionality may include paid addons, but the core software will ***always*** remain free.

## Development timeline
The project is currently in open *Beta*, as most of the major functionality has already been built. A date has not yet been set for full release, but the project author welcomes testers who want to help polish it before that time!

## Installation
Just upload the project files to an empty directory on your localhost or web host and migrate to the `/setup/rsdb-config.php` page to get started. This page will ask you for your database details, including the database name, your username, and password. If all goes well, a configuration file will be created and you'll move to the next step, at `/setup/rsdb-install.php`. You will be asked to choose a name for your new website and create a username and password for your administrator account. Once that's done, you'll be taken to the login page (`/login.php`) where you can log in to the account you just created and get started building your website. It's that simple!
